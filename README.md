A quiz web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would allow users to test their knowledge on various topics. The app would use an API and the fetch() function to retrieve a set of questions and answers from a database. 

The app would present the user with a series of multiple-choice questions and track their answers. At the end of the quiz, the app would display the user's score and potentially offer them the option to retake the quiz or view their incorrect answers. 

The HTML and CSS would be used to structure and style the app, while JavaScript would handle the logic for retrieving and presenting the quiz questions and tracking the user's answers.
